## How the result came out

### We selected top 30% of requirements engineering
![selected_req](https://github.com/idealization/software-engineering/blob/main/OSD/02_payment/image/selected_req.png)
These reqs are related to use case 1, 2, 3.

### Then we defined use case 1, 2, 3 again according to top 30% of reqs.
